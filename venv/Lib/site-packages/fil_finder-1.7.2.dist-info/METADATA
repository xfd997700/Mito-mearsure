Brief Description
-----------------

FilFinder is a Python package for extraction and analysis of filamentary structure in molecular clouds. In particular, the algorithm is capable of uniformly extracting structure over a large dynamical range in intensity (see images below). FilFinder supports python 2 and 3.

The algorithm proceeds through multiple steps:

* FilFinder segments filamentary structure by using `adaptive thresholding <http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/plot_threshold_adaptive.html>`__. This performs thresholding over local neighborhoods, allowing for the extraction of structure over a large dynamic range.
* The final filament mask is constructed by applying morphological operators to remove extraneous small regions. The order of these operations are:

    * (Optionally) Flatten using an arctan transform - this removes the effects of small bright features (ie. cores) from effecting the filament mask.
    * Smooth with a small median filter (half the size of the expected filament widths) - this decreases fragmentation of regions in the final mask
    * Apply the adaptive threshold - the patch size is set to the expected filament width (0.1 pc) by default - this sets the scale of the objects to be detected. Within a factor of a few, this size does not effect the result greatly. The widths of the masked regions are not used for deriving any physical properties.
    * Objects below a set area threshold are removed to give the final mask - For the HGBS data, we found a good threshold was 5 * (0.1 pc)^2 but this may change depending on the data the algorithm is used on.

* The final regions are reduced to skeletons via a `Medial Axis Transform <http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/plot_medial_transform.html>`__ for further analysis.
* Pixels within each skeleton are classified by the number of connecting pixels. A pixel can be a body point, end point, or intersection point. The skeletons are broken up into a set of branches to determine the length.
* The length is determined by converting the set of branches into a graph. Nodes on the graph are intersections and end points. The branches make up the connections and their weighting in the graph is determined by their length and average intensity. A shortest path algorithm determines the longest path through the skeleton, which is reported as the main length.
* The skeletons are then pruned by removing branches that are: not in the main length, will not affect the connectivity of the entire graph if they are removed, and whose length and average intensity are below a set threshold.
* The width of the filament is determined by building a radial profile using the distance from the skeleton. This is accomplished by using a Euclidean Distance Transform and binning the intensity values of the pixels based on their minimum distance from a skeleton pixel. By default, a Gaussian with a constant background is fit to the profile. The reported filament width is the FWHM after deconvolving with the the FWHM of the beam.
* A measure of filament direction and curvature is found using the `Rolling Hough Transform <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...789...82C>`__. This method returns a distribution of angles, from which the mean and variance are  defined using circular statistics.

These are the basic steps of the algorithm, which will return the main filament properties: local amplitude and background, width, length, orientation and curvature. Additional tools are available, such as creating a filament-only image based on the properties of the radial fits.

The resulting mask and skeletons may be saved in FITS format. Property tables may be saved as a csv, fits or latex table. See the ```fil_finder_2D``` documentation for more details.
